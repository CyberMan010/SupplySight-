## üìä Usage Tutorial

1. **Dashboard Overview:**  
   On launch, view KPIs (Total Stock, Total Demand, Fill Rate) and a trend chart for inventory.

2. **Filtering Products:**  
   Use the search bar, warehouse dropdown, and status filter to find products.

3. **Product Table:**  
   Click on any product row to open the side drawer for details.

4. **Product Drawer:**  
   - **Details Tab:** View stock, demand, SKU, warehouse, and utilization.

## üí° Decisions & Trade-offs

See [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) for more details:

- Mock data and a simple Node.js GraphQL backend for rapid prototyping.
- Apollo Client chosen for robust caching and error handling.
- UI/UX focused on clarity and responsiveness.
- Strict TypeScript typing for reliability.
- Error boundaries and loading skeletons for better user experience.
- No automated tests due to time constraints.

---

## üß© Improvements with More Time

- Replace mock backend with a real database and authentication.
- Add unit, integration, and E2E tests.
- Audit and improve accessibility (ARIA, keyboard navigation).
- Optimize queries, pagination, and bundle size.
- Add product CRUD, warehouse CRUD, user roles, notifications, and real-time updates.
- Refine design, add dark mode, and improve mobile experience.
- Expand API docs and developer guides.
